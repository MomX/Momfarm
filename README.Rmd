devtools::install_github("MomX/Momfarm")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# plot_outlines <- function(s){
#   s %>% paper_white %>% draw_outlines(col="pink")
# }
#
# mate <- homogeneize(shapes[11], shapes[4], sample=240)
#
# for (i in seq(0, 1, length=100)){
#   hybridize(mate, cross=i) %>% plot_outlines()
#   Sys.sleep(1/10)
# }
```
